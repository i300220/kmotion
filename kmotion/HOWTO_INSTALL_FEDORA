************************** FEDORA : MANUAL INSTALL *****************************

(1) Disable SELinux

vi /etc/selinux/config

and change ...
SELINUX=enforcing

to ...
SELINUX=disabled

reboot machine




(2)  Download packages

install mod_python through YUM ... this pulls in apache as a dependency

Download motion repository from ...
http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/DownloadFiles

Download kmotion, v2.14a or later ...




(3) make www

mkdir /www
chmod a=rwx /www
cd /www

kmotion runs as a normal user, not root, so copy the kmotion_2.14a_beta.tar.gz 
to /www but ensure that the owner and group are set to your users name and group, 
ie in my case dave ...

-rw-rw-r--  1 dave dave 962560 2010-02-27 03:16 kmotion_2.14_Beta.tar.gz

Then as a user dave, gunzip and untar ...
gunzip kmotion_2.14a_beta.tar.gz
tar xvf kmotion_2.14_beta.tar




(4)  Selecting the ramdisk location

kmotion needs a ramdisk directory to store frequently changing images, Normally 
this is in /dev/shm/ but if /dev/shm is less than 30MB (execute df -h) or your 
distro does not support ramdisks you can use any directory as a virtual ramdisk. 

Edit /www/kmotion/core/core_rc and change the ramdisk location to 
something like

ramdisk_dir = /dev/shm/kmotion_ramdisk ... or ...
ramdisk_dir = /www/kmotion/www/virtual_ramdisk

*NOTE* definitely use a real ramdisk if you have a SSD (ie flash) drive




(5)  Install core

cd /www/kmotion
./install_core.py




(6) Modifying apache2 conf

Edit your apache2 configuration file, its at '/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf' At the
end of the file add:

# Include kmotion vhosts directory
Include /www/kmotion/www/vhosts/kmotion




(7) Restart apache2

/etc/init.d/httpd restart  




(8) Moving the exe's

Move the kmotion exe's 'kmotion' and 'kmotion_ptz' to your path, ie 
'/usr/local/bin', '/usr/bin' or '/bin' etc. 

cd /www/kmotion
mv kmotion /usr/local/bin
mv kmotion_ptz /usr/local/bin




(9) Setting permissions and GID's

chgrp apache /www/kmotion/www/fifo* 
chmod 0660  /www/kmotion/www/fifo* 

chgrp apache /www/kmotion/servo_state
chmod 0640 /www/kmotion/servo_state

chgrp -R apache /www/kmotion/www/mutex
chmod -R 0770 /www/kmotion/www/mutex




(10) Getting kmotion to start when your system starts


A '/etc/init.d/httpd start' needs to be executed as root on startup else apache
fails to start.

Also 'kmotion start' needs to be executed on startup as a normal user, in my
case dave. There are many ways this can be done but my personal favourite is by
using cron.

crontab -e
and add:
@reboot /usr/local/bin/kmotion start &




(11) Start kmotion

kmotion start

Point your browser (hopefully firefox) to 'http://localhost:8085' OR 
'http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8085' the default username is 'kmotion', the default 
password is 'kmotion'.
