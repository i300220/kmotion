PT(Z) HOWTO

PT(Z) is achieved either through motion or kmotions own drivers and is selected 
by the driver dropdown list in the PT(Z) configuration.

I struggled for quite a while to get my PT(Z) Logitec orbit webcam to pan and 
tilt under Linux. This is how I got it to go :)

Check the motion documentation and ensure you have setup ...

On ubuntu you need sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libxml2-dev 

Follow this link to compile the module and uvcdynctrl tool ...

The Logitec 'logitec.xml' file will not work. It needs to be modified follow this link ... 
http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/SupportQuestion2008x01x29x112921
I have included a copy of my 'modified_logitec.xml' file in the kmotion docs folder.

Finally execute the following ...

libwebcam-0.1.1/build/Apps/uvcdynctrl$ ./uvcdynctrl -i /.../modified_logitech.xml

And test with test 'http://localhost:8080/1/track/set'

*NOTE* You need to execute 
'libwebcam-0.1.1/build/Apps/uvcdynctrl$ ./uvcdynctrl -i /.../modified_logitech.xml' 
every time you boot.
