The 'event' directory holds shell scripts that are executed when motion is 
detected and when motion ceases. This is a direct tap off of 'motions' 
'on_event_start' and 'on_event_end' options. This feature is useful for turning 
on lights, sounding horns etc ... on a remote site.

The  scripts MUST be of the format 'event_start<2 dig num 01-16>.sh

For example :

Create a file called event_start01.sh in the event directory, containing 
the following ...

#!/bin/bash
touch ~/Desktop/There\ is\ motion

Create a file called event_end01.sh in the event directory, containing 
the following ...

#!/bin/bash
rm ~/Desktop/There\ is\ motion

Make them executable with ...

chmod +x event_start01.sh
chmod +x event_end01.sh

Finally create motion in front of camera 1 and magically a file
called 'There is motion !' appears on your desktop. When the motion
stops the message disappears.
