The 'func' directory holds shell scripts that are executed when the appropriate 
function button is clicked in the web interface. This feature is useful for 
turning on lights, sounding horns, opening barriers etc ... on a remote site.

The shell scripts MUST be of the format 'func<2 dig num 01-16>.sh

For example :

Create a file called func08.sh in the func directory, containing the following ...

#!/bin/bash
touch ~/Desktop/f8\ has\ been\ pressed

Make it executable with ...

chmod +x func08.sh

And tell kmotion to update with...

kmotion restart

Finally reload your web page, press 'func' followed by 'f8' and magically a file 
called 'f8 has been pressed' appears on your desktop.
