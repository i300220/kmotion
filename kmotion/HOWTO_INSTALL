*************************** GENERIC : AUTO INSTALL *****************************


The auto install script, try this first.

sudo ./install.py 
kmotion start

and if you want to uninstall

sudo ./uninstall.py


*************************** GENERIC : MANUAL INSTALL ***************************


If the automated install script fails for any reason you may want to try a 
manual install.

Where you find <path to kmotion dir>, substitute your path to kmotion your 
kmotion directory ie  in my case '/home/dave/kmotion' !!


(1)  Check the dependencies

kmotion v2 needs a minimum of :

apache2 ...             v2.2.x 
apache2 python module   v3.3.x
motion ...              v3.2.x
python ...              v2.4.x

If you are running Debian / Ubuntu or a derivative use the following command

apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-python motion python




(2)  Selecting the ramdisk location

kmotion needs a ramdisk directory to store frequently changing images, Normally 
this is in /dev/shm/ but if /dev/shm is less than 30MB (execute df -h) or your 
distro does not support ramdisks you can use any directory as a virtual ramdisk. 

Edit /<path to kmotion dir>/core/core_rc and change the ramdisk location to 
something like

ramdisk_dir = /dev/shm/kmotion_ramdisk ... or ...
ramdisk_dir = <path to kmotion dir>/www/virtual_ramdisk

*NOTE* definitely use a real ramdisk if you have a SSD (ie flash) drive




(3)  Install core

cd <path to kmotion>/kmotion
./install_core.py




(4) Modifying apache2 conf

Locate and edit your apache2 configuration file, normally its  
'/etc/apache2/apache2.conf' but may be under a different name or location 
dependent on your distro. At the end of the file add:

# Include kmotion vhosts directory
Include <path to kmotion dir>/www/vhosts/kmotion




(5) Restart apache2

Restart apache2, normally this is something like:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart  




(6) Moving the exe's

Move the kmotion exe's 'kmotion' and 'kmotion_ptz' to your path, ie 
'/usr/local/bin', '/usr/bin' or '/bin' etc. The exe's can be found at 
<path to kmotion dir>.

cd <path to kmotion dir>
mv kmotion /usr/local/bin
mv kmotion_ptz /usr/local/bin




(7) Setting permissions and GID's

You need to change the permissions and group of the following to the 'run as' 
group of apache.

The 'run as' group is specific to each distro and can be found in the apache
config files. For Debian / Ubuntu it is 'www-data', for Suse it is 'www' etc ...

Assuming a 'run as' group of 'www-data' ...

chgrp www-data <path to kmotion dir>/www/fifo* 
chmod 0660  <path to kmotion dir>/www/fifo* 

chgrp www-data <path to kmotion dir>/servo_state
chmod 0640 <path to kmotion dir>/servo_state

chgrp -R www-data <path to kmotion dir>/www/mutex
chmod -R 0770 <path to kmotion dir>/www/mutex




(8) Getting kmotion to start when your system starts

A 'kmotion start' needs to be executed as a normal user on system startup. There 
are many ways this can be done but my personal favourite is by using cron.

crontab -e
and add:
@reboot <path to kmotion exe's>/kmotion start &




(9) Start kmotion

kmotion start

Point your browser (hopefully firefox) to 'http://localhost:8085' OR 
'http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8085' the default username is 'kmotion', the default 
password is 'kmotion'.
